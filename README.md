# C-OOP-Project
Y1S2 C++ OOP Project


Requirements:
-Create a C++ project in Visual Studio

-Define/create a class A (e.g. Person, Account, etc.) 

-Define at least 5 private attributes specific to the class defined in step 2 

-Define Set and Get methods for the attributes defined in step 3 

-The attributes and methods should be defined in a .h file 

-Implement the methods defined in step 4 

-Define/create a Main class

-In the main method of the Main class, define 2 objects. One of the objects should be defined using a pointer. 

-Set the values of the attributes for the 2 objects and display the values to the console.

-Define at least 2 parameterized constructors. Definition should be done in the .h file. Implement code for each constructor. Print specific messages for each constructor .

-Instantiate 2 objects in the Main class using the defined constructors. Check the message displayed in the console .

-Define a destructor. Implement the destructor. Print specific messages inside the destructor. Check the message displayed in the console .

-Define and use at least 2 initialization lists .

-Define and use constructor delegation .

-Use the "this" pointer .

-Define a static attribute and use it to count the number of objects defined for the class. Display the value in the console .

-Use a constant in the code .

-Create a UML diagram (following the model from last Thursday) that highlights the inheritance relationship between at least 4 defined classes. The base class is considered the one defined previously. The hierarchy must be logical. You can use, but not mandatory, this site to create the UML diagram: https://www.smartdraw.com/uml-diagram/uml-diagram-tool.htm

-Define 4 more attributes for the base class: 2 public and 2 protected.

-Define and create class E. Class E must have at least 2 attributes and a defined and implemented method. Define in class A a protected object of type class E. Don't forget, the relationship between A and E must be "A has a E".

-Define and create classes B, C, and D. Each class must have 2 defined attributes and a method. Class B must also have a defined protected attribute. In at least one child class, override a method.

-Separate the definitions into .h files.

-Call the method defined in E in classes B, C, and D through the inherited object from A .

-Create objects of each class type in the Main class. Call methods to highlight inheritance
